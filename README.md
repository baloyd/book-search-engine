# book-search-engine

This application is a book search engine that utilises the Google Books API to return a list of books searched by the user. The user is able to login/signup, search for a book, save the book to a list that can then be viewed later on as well as delete said book from their list.

## User Story

SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```

The app was built using a React front end, MongoDB database, Apollo client server and GraphQL API for routing. It also utilizes a json web token for user authentication.
